I just reread my previous post and chuckled quietly to myself. How can I expect to succeed at any long-term goal without a system set in place? I just downloaded a productivity / to-do list app, [HabitRPG](https://habitica.com/static/home), for my phone a few days ago and so far I'm having fair success using it. I just added "Write a paragraph" to my dailies so maybe - just maybe - you'll see more here soon.

I want to create short, informative, digestible content. I may not be able to swing all three qualifiers in every post, but it's a start. Maybe I'll do how-tos as I often find myself scouring the web for several resources that amount to some semblance of a tutorial. I've been toying around with Linux as I recently received a Raspberry Pi for my birthday so there's plenty of potential for tutorials written from the perspective of a newbie.

I started this post out with the title "recollection" because I remembered that I wanted to make a habit out of writing. I remembered that I had been foolish. "Silly Witt, how foolish you were five months ago!" _No._ I think to the me that is looking at the past. _I still am that foolish boy who thinks he can declare a motive and it just happen effortlessly. I fail. I fail often. I often fail miserably. And without a plan of attack it's going to continue to happen._ So, don't just remember. Recollect. Collect again the mistakes and carry forward the knowledge that change won't occur unless you make it.
