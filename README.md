Planning to use 11ty and TailwindCSS to make a pretty, FAST site that isn't a pain to manage or update.

Run it
```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy

```

Serve it up at [localhost](http://localhost:8080/)
```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
# or 
npm run serve
```

Now using Zola.
For development, you can get it running like this:
```powershell
# nav to site folder
cd wittallen-com/
zola serve
```

Then open [localhost:1111](http://127.0.0.1:1111)
