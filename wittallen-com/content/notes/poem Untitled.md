POEM: Untitled

3-23-10 Poem
Inspiration: CSI, sliding backwards on a clover-covered hill, love/relationships, mystery of identity

{rearrange these lines}
no warmth in your grip
no love in your lips
what's the point of this?
and I can feel us sliding backwards
climbing up a clover-covered hill
and everything is beautiful
but the ground is slick with dew
and I wonder what's the point of you
