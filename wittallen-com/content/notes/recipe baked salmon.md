## Temperature
>375 degrees F for a 2-pound side of salmon.

## Time
>- The baking time will vary based upon the size and thickness of your salmon. For example, I like to try to buy wild-caught salmon, which in our store usually means sockeye or coho based on inventory. These varieties are thinner and thus cook more quickly.
>- If you are using farm-raised salmon (often the case with the popular Atlantic salmon), your side will likely be thicker and need more time.

Wrap the foil completely
Check at 15, 20, 25 minutes

## Experience
Put olive oil in the foil first, then put down the fish
Soy sauce on top is pretty good
Go harder with the spices next time (cumin, curry, chopped onions, salt, garlic salt)
Try out fewer spices next time

Trying a fairly liberal amount of chili powder coating a soy sauce drizzled fillet
That was pretty, dang good. Keep going with the strategy of 1 spice and a liberal amount.

Did the above again. Still tasty.

Trying soy sauce + shwarma
Not bad. Shwarma is pretty weak flavoring.
