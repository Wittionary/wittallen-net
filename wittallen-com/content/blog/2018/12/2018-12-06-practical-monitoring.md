I recently snapped up Practical Monitoring by [Mike Julian](https://twitter.com/mike_julian) during a DevOps [book bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books) and don't regret it a bit. I haven't read through a book that fast since [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592). It was a great resource to help me solidify essential monitoring principals, showed me where my gaps are, and introduced me to monitoring methods I haven't yet had the opportunity to play with.

This has been a robotic, fan-boy post. If you want a high-level overview on what good monitoring is or want a little direction on where to take your toolset or maybe you're just the only person on your team that cares about monitoring, read a sample chapter on Amazon and consider adding this knowledge to your repository.
