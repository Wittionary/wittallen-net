Writing can be difficult. It _is_ difficult. Not the tippy-tappy party my fingers do on the keys. The pre-pre-pre-draft of the fourth version of the second mental edit.

Between the previous line and this one I've turned over a half-dozen different phrasings of the same idea. Now, don't get me wrong; words are important.

Whoops. I froze up again. Point is, dear reader, keep writing. Don't stop. [Don't stop 'til you get enough.](https://youtu.be/yURRmWtbTbo?t=1m14s)
