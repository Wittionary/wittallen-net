Non-comprehensive.
What qualifies as a tool?
What is invaluable to me?
What it does, when I use it, how it helps me, the value it adds.

## hardware
headphones
- ear(2)
- Sony MX3000(?)

pens
- Pilot G-2 10
- Pentel GFKP brush pen

pencil
- Rotring 600 Mechanical Pencil, 0.7 mm, Silver

Field Notes
- Analog notes. So satisfying.

Pixel 6 (Android)
- I'm cooling off on Google. This device has been going strong for me, but, week by week, I grow progressively dismayed and horrified by surveillance capitalism and the non-separation of Tech and State. ~~I intend on trying out GrapheneOS on a newer Pixel model within the next year or so.~~

Pixel 9a (GrapheneOS)
- I'm slowly moving trusted apps over to this device, scrutinizing what I really need, and prioritizing FOSS alternatives to Big Tech options. Current challenge: music
- The battery life on this thing is amazing. I haven't charged it in 9 days and it's only at 21%.

## peripherals
Mistel Barocco MD770
- 65(?)-key split-staggered keyboard

logitech G502 hero wired mouse

## software
espanso for text expansion
- Quickly write generic emails, chats, common meeting responses.
- Pre-determine the polite, professional version of what I want to say. `;;googleit` -> "What have your search results yielded?"

vscode, trying out zed

obsidian
- Digital notes and persistent diagrams through its Canvas feature. Previously used Simplenote and the green one with an elephant mascot.
- I try to do as much here as possible.

~~anki~~
- Anki is great when I use it, but I haven't studied in well over a year. It's worth a mention. Though I could make more use of it regularly, I don't.

spotify

bandcamp

todoist
- Task mismanagement and reminders.

ticktick
- work task management

terminal + extensions

~~zapier~~

## processes / methods
GTD
Eisenhower matrix
Which task feels biggest in my mind?
What's the question here? If this seems like it's taking too long, is there a workaround?
Am I holding onto an idealized end state? Can I let go of it to make headway on this?
