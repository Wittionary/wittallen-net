### Page bio
I am a St. Jude Hero! 
This December, I'm running the St. Jude marathon to fundraise in honor of my nephew, Josiah. He was diagnosed with glioma astrocytoma (brain cancer) at 6 months of age. Thanks to the life-changing research, breakthrough medicines, and amazing professionals at St. Jude that have cared for him over the years, he'll be turning 13 years old this November.
With your donation we can cross the fundraising finish line together because the money you donate helps find a cure for childhood cancer!
Did you know:
-   Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food - because all a family should worry about is helping their child live.
-   Treatments invented at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to more than 80% since it opened more than 50 years ago. St. Jude won't stop until no child dies from cancer.
-   St. Jude freely shares the discoveries it makes, and every child saved at St. Jude means doctors and scientists worldwide can use that knowledge to save thousands more children.
Donate today to help me reach my goal. Even when the race is over, the fight to end childhood cancer continues. Also please consider sharing this fundraising page on social media: http://witt.run
