This isn't the first time I've written an introductory blog post or the second time I've declared my intent to commit, so I won't let this be the third. No more new blogs or switching hosting providers. No more analysis paralysis or obsessively editing un-written content. It's time to defecate or evacuate the latrine. 

Mistakes are momentum.
