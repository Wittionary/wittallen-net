    <h1>I'm Witt ðŸ’¾</h1><br>
    Witt Allen. I work on a site reliability engineering team as a DevOps Platform engineer. During the day, I spend my time
    <ul class="repeating-counter-rule">
        <li>automating repetitive tasks with various tools</li>
        <li>building monitoring to increase systems observability</li>
        <li>engineering systems to be resilient</li>
    </ul>
    I also enjoy weight-lifting, hiking, backpacking, ukelele-ing, and, occassionally, D&D.
