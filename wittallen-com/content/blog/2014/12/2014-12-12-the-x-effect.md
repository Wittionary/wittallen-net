I discovered and started using this productivity / habit-development method today. It's called [The X Effect](https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/). I found it on Reddit via the _get disciplined_ [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/). The short version is willpower is like a muscle; it only gets stronger by exercising. After repeating a small, doable task for forty-nine days, you're darn near close to turning that repetitive action into a habit. From there, you increase the difficulty in whatever degree you see fit. You can find the longer, more thorough version in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1x99m6/im_a_piece_of_shit_no_more_games_no_more_lies_no/cf9dz72).

As always, I'll try anything that I think will force / grow me to be more productive, more happy. I'm using the [7 Weeks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ryan.brooks.sevenweeks.app) app that was actually made by someone as a [result](https://www.reddit.com/r/theXeffect/comments/2839zy/thank_you_rthexeffect/) of using forty-nine day method. In addition to that, I'm recording everything manually in my Field Notes too. Drawing the X feels so nice.
