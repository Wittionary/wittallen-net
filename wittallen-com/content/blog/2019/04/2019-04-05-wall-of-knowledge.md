The past few days I've been reacquainting myself with Python and I can say it feels really good to get to the point where I'm not constantly looking up syntax. Well, I mean, I still am, but not on every single line of code. I've got the logical facilities to forge my path ahead, but previously have been coming up against that hurdle of knowledge that one encounters when learning any new powerful technology. Now I feel like I've finally got my legs underneath me a little bit. Even hitting a flow state now and then.

If you find yourself also hitting that wall, keep it up, Champ. 👩🏽‍💻
