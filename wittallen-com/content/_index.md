# I'm Witt ðŸ’¾

Witt Allen. I work on a site reliability engineering team as a DevOps Platform engineer. During the day, I spend my time
- automating repetitive tasks with various tools
- building monitoring to increase systems observability
- engineering systems to be resilient

I also enjoy weight-lifting, hiking, backpacking, ukelele-ing, and, occassionally, D&D.
