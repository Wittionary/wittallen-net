## [niche-os](#niche-os)

**niche-os** is my nix OS (aka NixOS) configuration. If you're not familiar with what nix OS is, it's a complicated way of setting up a computer the exactly same way each time. So, if I got a brand new laptop, all I would need to do is install the basic nix OS, copy my **niche-os** project to it, run a few commands, and I'd have the same setup on it as I do on 2-3 of my other computers.

My motivation behind diving into this was I was tired of setting up a linux machine and then being afraid of making changes to it and forgetting how I set it up and breaking it, wasting a bunch of time and effort. because there are a hundred little configuration files.

This project is currently in a _working_ state. It's usable by anyone, but, like most configuration files, highly personal to suit my needs.

Since I don't have a full blog post on the topic yet, I'll offer my brief, brief thoughts on NixOS: stay far, far away from it unless you really want your hobby to be fixing your computer, not using it. It's a barefoot, uphill battle on LEGO. You are a blinded Sisyphus and each brief victory is overshadowed by the boulder of esoteric linux knowledge careening into the valley of indecipherable error messages.
